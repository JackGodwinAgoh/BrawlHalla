            <h2>Tin </h2>
            <p>Tin 1: 0 - 874 Elo </p>

            <p>   Tin 2: 875 - 924 Elo</p>

            <p>   Tin 3: 925 - 974 Elo</p>

            <p>Tin rank is the starting point for new players who are just beginning to learn the game’s mechanics.
                 At this stage, players are still getting familiar with basic controls, movement, and attacks.
                  There is little to no strategy involved, with most players relying on button-mashing rather than intentional gameplay. 
                  Many struggle with recovery and frequently fall off the stage by accident due to a lack of awareness of jump and dodge mechanics.
                   Attacks are often random and uncoordinated, with little understanding of combos, spacing, or effective dodging. </p>

            
            <h2>Bronze</h2>
            <p>Bronze 1: 975 - 1024 Elo</p>
            <p>Bronze 2: 1025 - 1074 Elo</p>
            <p>Bronze 3: 1075 - 1124 Elo</p>


            <p>At the Bronze rank, players begin to develop a basic understanding of Brawlhalla’s mechanics but still make frequent mistakes.
                 Dodging becomes more common, but many players struggle with timing, making their dodges predictable and ineffective. Some players
                  start experimenting with light attack combos, though execution is often inconsistent. Despite improving slightly, recovery skills
                   remain a weak point, and many still fall off the stage due to poor jump and dodge usage. A large number of players at this level 
                   continue to rely on spamming attacks rather than focusing on positioning, spacing, or reading their opponent’s movements.
                    
                </p>
            
            <h2>Silver </h2>
            <p>Silver 1: 1125 - 1174 Elo</p>
            <p>Silver 2: 1175 - 1224 Elo</p>
            <p>Silver 3: 1225 - 1274 Elo</p>

            <p>Silver-ranked players begin to develop stronger movement skills and start incorporating basic strategies into their gameplay. 
                Light attack combos become more consistent, allowing for better damage output and smoother engagements. Dodging is used more intentionally,
                 though many players still have predictable dodge habits that can be punished by more experienced opponents. Recovery skills improve significantly, 
                 with players utilizing wall jumps and dodges more effectively to return to the stage. At this level, the skill gap between low Silver and high Silver
                  players becomes apparent, as higher-ranked players display better positioning, reaction time, and combo execution. </p>
    
    
            <h2>Gold</h2>
            <p>Gold 1: 1275 - 1324 Elo</p>
            <p>Gold 2: 1325 - 1374 Elo</p>
            <p>Gold 3: 1375 - 1424 Elo</p>
            <p>Gold 4: 1425 - 1474 Elo</p>

            <p>The Rocket Lance is a polearm with a rocket booster at the rear of its hilt. Legends will often use the rocket for mobility purposes
                 as well as attacking. This weapon is very useful for aerial combat.The Rocket Lance is a long-range melee weapon that thrives on aerial 
                 mobility and powerful knockbacks. It allows players to rush down opponents with high-speed attacks or control space with long-reaching
                 strikes. With its boosted movement and devastating attacks, the Rocket Lance is great for keeping opponents at a distance while dealing 
                 heavy damage. For players who enjoy long-range combat and aerial mobility, offering high damage potential</p>
    
            <h2>Platinum</h2>
            <p>Platinum 1: 1475 - 1524 Elo</p>
            <p>Platinum 2: 1525 - 1574 Elo</p>
            <p>Platinum 3: 1575 - 1624 Elo</p>
            <p>Platinum 4: 1625 - 1674 Elo</p>
            
            <p>Platinum-ranked players have a solid grasp of advanced movement techniques such as fast falling, gravity cancels, and directional dodging. At this level,
                 gameplay becomes more strategic, with a strong emphasis on combos and dodge reads. Players can effectively predict their opponents' dodging habits and
                  counter accordingly, leading to more efficient punishes and extended combos. Mind games and baiting tactics are commonly used to trick opponents into
                   making mistakes, creating openings for high-damage follow-ups. Stage control becomes a key focus, with players actively managing space to maintain
                   an advantage, control engagements, and limit their opponent’s movement options. Platinum represents a high level of skill, where players refine
                    their execution and develop a deeper understanding of competitive pla</p>

            <h2>Diamond</h2>
            <p>2000+ Elo – The Elite Tier</p>
            <p>Diamond-ranked players are among the best in Brawlhalla, demonstrating near-complete mastery of the game's mechanics. Their movement, spacing, and advanced
                 combos are executed with precision, allowing them to control engagements and dictate the pace of the match. At this level, players can consistently predict 
                 their opponents’ moves, using advanced dodge reads to extend combos and maximize damage. Their decision-making is highly refined, with every action serving
                  a specific purpose—there are no wasted movements or attacks. Mistakes are punished severely, and adaptability is key, as Diamond players can quickly adjust 
                  their strategies based on their opponent’s playstyle. This rank is a testament to a player’s dedication, skill, and deep understanding of the game’s competitive dynamics</p>
    
             <h2>Valhallan</h2>
             <p>2100+ Elo + Top 150 in Region – The Best of the Best</p>
             <p>The Valhallan rank is the pinnacle of Brawlhalla’s ranked system, reserved for the absolute best players in the world. Those who achieve this rank consistently
                 compete in high-level tournaments and dominate the top leaderboards. Every aspect of their gameplay is perfected, from precise dodge reads to flawlessly 
                 punishing even the smallest mistakes. Their mechanics, reactions, and decision-making are unmatched, allowing them to outplay opponents with strategic 
                 precision and near-flawless execution. Valhallan players demonstrate an elite level of skill, making split-second decisions that can turn the tide of a match</p>
