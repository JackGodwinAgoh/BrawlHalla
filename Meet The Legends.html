        <h3>Artemis-The Awnser</h3>
        <p>Born Mary Washington in West Plaza, New York, she was a voracious reader with a love for strawberry ice cream. While Mary had a relatively normal childhood,
           her parents sometimes wondered why she would read stories of the goddess Artemis killing the hunter Orion over and over again. One day, she found herself in 
           a dark alley, confronted by a creature from the void of space. The creature infected her, and she was transformed into Artemis, a being of cosmic power. Now,
           as The Destroyer, she seeks to eliminate Orion, whom she perceives as a threat to the universe</p>

        <h3>Orion-The Mysterious Stranger</h3>
        <p>Orion is an enigmatic warrior clad in futuristic armor crafted by Asgardian dwarves. He arrived in Valhalla as a comet from space, and though he initially appeared 
          aloof, he has become one of Valhalla's greatest and most popular champions. Orion does not speak of his past, and his true origins remain a mystery.

        <h3>Dusk-The Renegade Sorcerer</h3>
        <p>Dusk was once a powerful sorcerer who sought forbidden magic in hopes of gaining more power. His obsession led him to use dark, destructive magic, which transformed

             is haunted by his past and is on a quest for redemption, hoping to undo the curse he brought upon himself..</p>

       <h3>Vector-The Cybernetic Hunter</h3>

          Now, as a relentless hunter, he travels across time and space, eliminating any threats to the future of his people. Despite his mechanical enhancements, his human will
